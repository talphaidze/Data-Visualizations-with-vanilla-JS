    <!-- Exercise 1: Color Scales-->
    <p>
        <strong>Exercise 1</strong><br><br>
        <strong>A:</strong><br>
        It is an effective divergent scale. We can see that the left part is going to red,<br>
         possibly denoting negative effect, and the right part going to the blue color with its saturation increasing, <br>
         probably denoting a positive effect. Overall, the scale is effective and conveys information in a way that is easily<br>
         understood by the user.<br><br>
        <strong>B:</strong><br>
        This is a rather ineffective color scale. To begin with, the right side that is getting darker <br>
        is usually assigned to positive values and the left side is usually assigned to negative values. <br>
        This is because we usually read from left to right, and it only makes sense to go from the negative values <br>
        on the left to the positive values on the right. This is the first way in which the color scale is misleading. <br>
        Secondly, as we are speaking about going from negative (-1) to positive (1) values with 0 as a neutral point,<br>
        I believe that it would be most effective to use a divergent color scale rather than a sequential one.<br><br>
        <strong>C:</strong><br>
        There are several anomalous color vision deficiencies that cause the loss of perceivable hue variation.<br>
        In this case, we used 'Coblis' simulator to identify what specific anomalies applied to the image given in the homework.<br>
        First of all, Blue-Weak/Tritanomaly that is Anomalous Trichromacy caused the significant perception of the green part of the color scale,<br>
        meaning that people with this anomaly would not be able to perceive the green part. Afterwards, we identified that in Dichromatic views,<br> 
        Red-Blind/Protanopia and Green-Blind/Deuteranopia caused significant changes in the color perception. So individuals with these anomalies <br>
        would not be able to identify at all that they were dealing with blue to green color scale. Individuals with Blue-Blind/Tritanopia would not be <br>
        able to identify there was a green color in a scale at all. All of these conditions affect the color hue perception.<br><br>
        <strong>D:</strong><br>
        I would not recommend that they use a rainbow scale for a county-by-county map because on the map, the counties need to be <br>
        distinguishable with different color hues, not transitioning between each other.<br><br>
    </p>

    <!-- Exercise 2: NCAA Basketball Heatmap -->
    <p>
        <strong>Exercise 2</strong><br><br>
        One advantage of the logarithmic color scale is that it helps reveal variations in shot attempts in areas with lower activity,<br>
        making it easier to spot less-frequented regions on the court. However, a disadvantage is that it can exaggerate the differences<br>
        in high-activity areas, potentially making them appear even more intense than they are due to the compression of color values in the lower range of attempts.<br>
